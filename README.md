- 👋 Hi, I’m @HolLyWoOd801 Born & Raised In the good old (SL,UT) - *Yes that is Salt lake,Utah 🖖»·😳·«👍 there really is just a Bunch of SLUTS  out here..  💪🤠🤚
 Seriously!!

- 👀 I’m interested in 🤔🤔 This is a question, not a statement correct? Jk.. Nah I am Interested In Sexual Adventures W/Promiscuous Woman, Ones Desiring Multiple Men at Once 🙋😇... (it's a joke) Wait.. You Ment Work-Related Interestes.. Got It.. ( You can tell the girls it's not worK when you enjoy it so much) Anyhow I do Apologize.. #Sarcasm. Yes Well Actually during Quarantine, our time in Hell All Of the "Nothing" that I had going on, I was actually able to find myself captivated with all that weird muble jumble, I guess which is referred to as Coding?? YEAH.. That.. I like stuff like that. I mean it is extremely organized (TRANSLATED: Meaning it makes absolutely no sense to anyone, except the few which we are!!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... The Google Workspace, Google Cloud, Azure, GitHub, just kind of touching my toes down in a few different places. Also Microsoft Admin-Console. I have been doing as many of the free Webinars that I can, Trying random stuff that I know absolutely NOTHING about! Back in the day when computers we're almost as popular as sliced bread, You know, brand new to the market. Nothing yet to know about how they worked in anyway shape or form.. So that was my starting point.  I went & tore my Machine completely apart, so I could understand the inner workings of all that is incorporated inside. Then attempted to put it back together.. Found out what the Blue screen of death is.., I thinks most people back then we're so dense n lazy, they would just buy another one or pay someone to fix it.. Not Me!! I was like a Emu with their head in the sand. Figuring out what the hell I had just done? If I remember correctly it was a System that had the first Windows OS on it.. It took me like 4 months of typing little command-prompts here and there finally enabling a almost completely successful boot. The knowledge of DoS-Prompt & Floppy drives was the in thing then if I remember correctly.. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ... With Intellectuals that have been awakened by the sleeping beasts that all humanity is dealing with..I Mean Unless you are Asleep then you aren't really dealing with shit but maybe the average 9-5 Grind of Mass Hypnosis.. Ask yourself? Red Pill or Blue Pill? Which did you take?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well as with most things, if you are in proximity of the office coffee maker in the morning.. You could probably reach me there!! Shit you might have to ask Google how to reach me.. A.I. we all know probably has those answers about ourselves that we don't even know, and yet they are Surprisingly Accurate.. Or you could just give me a stroke with some keys, and I will respond as soon as I receive the hand-out/reach-around. Yup that guy..
       🙋🤷💁  IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST ANY OF YOU WITH ANY PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT, I WOULD LOVE TO JUMP ON IN AND SEE WHAT KINDA OF MESS I CAN MAKE OUT OF IT..
